## Instructions for use

To use this install script, you'll need to download it, set it to be executable and then run it as sudo.  

To do this, run the following at the command line of an Ubuntu 12.10 server instance:

'wget http://bit.ly/16LQNDS'
'mv 16LQNDS install.sh'
'sudo chmod +x install.sh'
'sudo ./install.sh'

From there, your MySQL root password will be P@ssword1 and it'll install MySQL 5.5, PHP 5 with Predis and Rediska as well as Redis 2.6.11.

Happy Sandboxing!
